          HAMMOND ORGAN ADDITIVE SYNTHESIS - A NEW METHOD<br>
=================================================================
</h3>
Copyright (C) 1997<a href="mailto:pauless@rahul.net"> Paul F Schnellbecher 'pauless@rahul.net'</a>
<p>
The first modern organ I ever played was a Hammond B-3 with a
Model 31H Leslie speaker.  It was in the local Methodist church. 
This was 1960 and I was fifteen when I became the organist.  I
studied piano beforehand and used the two volumes of the Ethel
Smith Hammond Organ Method in order to learn to operate the
console.  I was not any good at playing Tico Tico.  I was unhappy
with the registrations presented in the books and I didn't like
the standard preset key settings.  What to do?
</p><p>
In the organ bench I found a couple of booklets published by the
Hammond Organ Company which gave sample drawbar settings.  These
and the later-acquired Dictionary of Hammond Organ Stops said
that to sum a chorus of stops together it was necessary to use
the largest figure among the combination as the value for each
given drawbar.  Example:
</p><p>
</p><pre>
To combine:
     Open Diapason 8'    00 8876 540
     Open Flute 8'       00 7632 000
     Salicional 8'       00 4554 322

Use:                     00 8876 542
</pre><p>
I couldn't accept the idea that combining two powerful stops and
a medium string could be simulated by using the most powerful
stop with only a tiny contribution from the string.  The excuse
for this crock given by Stevens Irwin in the Dictionary is that
powerful stops have in their makeup the tone of other less
powerful stops.  Balderdash.  If this were so, 88 8888 888 would
sound perfectly thrilling.
</p><p>
Being a literal sort of person, I decided that if stops were to
be added, we would add:
</p><p></p><pre>     Open Diapason 8'     0  0    8  8  7  6    5  4  0
     Open Flute 8'        0  0    7  6  3  2    0  0  0
     Salicional 8'        0  0    4  5  5  4    3  2  2
                         -------------------------------
                          0  0   19 19 15 12    8  6  2
</pre><p>
In no case is any carrying done between columns!  We are summing
as many as nine separate quantities.

</p><p>

Since any partial may only be drawn out to 8, it is necessary in
most cases to divide down by two:
</p><p></p><pre>                          0  0   19 19 15 12    8  6  2
                         -------------------------------
                          0  0   10 10  8  6    4  3  1


</pre><p>
It's still too big, so we will divide down again:
</p><pre><p>
                          0  0   10 10  8  6    4  3  1
                         -------------------------------
                          0  0    5  5  4  3    2  2  1
</p><p></p></pre>
Divided down so that no drawbar's total is greater than eight, we
find the combination works out to 00 5543 221.
<p>
You can see from looking at it that this combination shows the
addition of the string much more than a combination by the
traditional method will.  The Open Flute doesn't work out to be
so prominent as one might expect, but from my experience with
pipe organs, I have come to expect a Melodia added to a big Open
will not make as much difference in the loudness as might be
expected.  It will add "fatness" to the sound.  Unfortunately we
are unable on a Hammond Organ to suggest this fatness other than
by switching on another speaker cabinet, perhaps.
</p><p>
Let's take one more example to compare the traditional and the
additive methods for combining stops.  This time we will combine
stops of more than one pitch:
</p><p></p><pre>     Singend Gedack 8'        0  0   8  4  4  0   0  0  0
     Copula 4'                0  0   0  6  0  5   0  2  1
     Quinta 2-2/3'            0  0   0  0  4  0   0  3  0
     Blockflote 2'            0  0   0  0  0  4   0  0  2
                             -----------------------------
     Traditional Combination  0  0   8  6  4  5   0  3  2
<p></p></pre>
I guarantee that if you drew these stops on the Positiv of your
local Baroque-style pipe organ, you would hear something more
like this:
<p></p><pre>     Singend Gedack 8'        0  0   8  4  4  0   0  0  0
     Copula 4'                0  0   0  6  0  5   0  2  1
     Quinta 2-2/3'            0  0   0  0  4  0   0  3  0
     Blockflote 2'            0  0   0  0  0  4   0  0  2
                             -----------------------------
     Sums                     0  0   8 10  8  9   0  5  3
                             -----------------------------
     Halved to fit            0  0   4  5  4  5   0  3  2

<p></p></pre>

Working with this system after some careful comparitive listening
will bring in some experience and judgement which says to try
strengthening the combination:
<p></p><pre>                              0  0   6  8  6  8   0  5  3
</pre><p>
This is a rather sprightly combination of stops.  You will want
in a case like this to play a little less legato than you
ordinarily do.
</p><p>
Before we get deeper into additive synthesis, I would like to
address some playing and equipment issues which will help make
the sounds you create more convincing.
</p><p>
I once played a Hammond C-3 which spoke through a large Leslie in
the choir stalls and through two arrays of six twelve-inch Jensen
speakers.  The Leslie and the Jensens were switched either/both. 
The Jensens were driven by MacIntosh amplifiers.  In this
environment, key click became a convincing substitute for pipe
chiff, and I would not have believed it had I not played it and
heard it for myself.
</p><p>
This brings up another matter about realism.  You can rack up a
set of good church Principal pipes in your living room, put
temporary styrofoam chips in the toes to cut the sheer volume so
the neighbors won't complain, and you will have a nice but
somewhat dull if intimate sound.
</p><p>
The same pipes set unenclosed and open-toed against a hard
plaster wall and above ear level will take on a much more
"cathedralesque" sound.  The difference is placement and
environment.  You can work toward this in a house by placing a
speaker cabinet on an upstairs landing.  Cranking up the treble
on it may also help the illusion of Big Instrument.
</p><p>
Another church where I was assistant organist had a Hammond CV
with an old upright "coffin" Hammond speaker.  The speaker was
rated at 20 watts.  This was not much output for a room seating
easily 200 people.  Because the ceiling was open beamed and the
walls hard plaster, there was almost no sound absorption.
</p><p>
For a stunt at a recital, I had a BSEE candidate tap into the
phono input on the preamplifier and run a line to the public
address amplifier phono input.  Everybody tells me the phono
input on a Hammond preamplifier is for input and that what we did
was severely unorthodox or that it should not have worked.  Be
that as it may, it worked most excellently!
</p><p>
The increase of complexity in sound was greater in effect than
the addition of a couple of twelve-inch RCA PA speakers up in the
rafters would suggest.  You will improve the sound of any Hammond
Organ immensely by having more than one sound source.  The
secondary sources do not have to be fancy to work.  But they
should not dominate the output of the tone cabinet(s).
</p><p>
The 8' Clarinet registration I used on some Lutheran chorales at
that recital surprised even me in its plaintive beauty with the
additional speakers operating -- 00 5161 431.  This registration
is at its best in the octave above Middle C.
</p><p>
Another help toward making a sound from the Hammond believeable
is to use it in an appropriate range.  Generally, the more
complex the character of the sound, the more convincing and
musical it will be above Middle C.  You should be careful adding
16-foot tone to Hammond registrations.  They become not grave and
serious but muddy very quickly if not handled with delicacy.
</p><p>
We will analyze a typical stoplist and build up some full
choruses from it next.
</p><p>
For reference, I am including the Hammond Preset Key equivalents
as reported in the Hammond FAQ.

Let us analyze the layout of these preset schemes.  First, the
sharps are almost always single stops of solo character.  This
makes them easy to locate.  Correspondingly, the naturals are
accompanimental tones and ensembles graded in strength from soft
to loud.  Everyone is at least subconsciously used to this sort
of layout, so I will preserve it when offering new schemes to
spruce up a Hammond's voicing.
<p>
Unfortunately, many of the tones, especially in the standard
scheme, are too much alike and too plain.  Strings need to be a
bit brighter and flutes a bit clearer.  Diapasons and chorus
reeds such as trumpets tend to be too much alike; hornlike for
the diapasons and choked for the trumpets.  The ensembles have no
sparkle.  We can fix this to some degree if we take the stoplist
of a well-appointed two-manual pipe organ and use the Hammond
preset keys in much the same way as we would combination pistons.

</p><p>






First, here is a simple way to improve the standard scheme:

I used the example pipe organ specification as a basis for a new
set of preset key drawbar combinations, It keeps solo stops on
the sharp keys and accompaniments and choruses on the naturals,
all in order of power.  I compared the unedtited totals for the
choruses and adjusted them slightly to make the large
combinations rise realistically in power.  This is the finished
data set:

Here is a representation of  a <a href="http://theatreorgans.com/hammond/hotally.zip">Lotus spreadsheet </a>which can be downloaded from this page. I prepared to
help with the adding of stops together.  I used the Lotus
spreadsheet to make the computations which led to the new preset
scheme above.
<p>
Each of the columns, SUB QNT UNISON OCT NAZ FIF TIERCE LAR SIF,
in the spreadsheet is added independently of the other columns. 
The actual total of "points" for each drawbar or partial is the
first line in the totals section below.  The totals are each
divided by two, independently of the other columns, three times.
</p><p>
You choose whichever set of totals has no figure greater than 8. 
You may need to round up or down to take care of decimals.  On
some Hammond models you can set a drawbar between numbers; other
models have clickstops between numbers.
</p><p>
This will put you close to the ensemble combination you seek. 
The effect of age on components in the organ, the characteristics
of the tone cabinets and the sort of room into which the organ
speaks with have some effect on the outcome.  You will need to
make final adjustments to the drawbar combination when you try it
under the conditions it will be used.

 Someone else may take the 
theatre organ scheme and work with it.  I don't feel qualified to do that.
</p><p>
I have a <a href="http://theatreorgans.com/hammond/hotally.zip%22"> Lotus spreadsheet</a> which can be used to add up single stops. It also works in MSWORKS or similar database programs.
